This Python program extracts the comments from a course evaluations file.

1. Ensure you have a header file for the course evaluations file that you'll be reading. Use adapt_header to generate this file.

2. Delete rows in the header file that you don't want in the final file. For example, Q1 should be deleted from the header file,
as it shouldn't be included in the final file.

3. Delete the index column in the header too!

4. Open constant.py. Tweek the options according to the comments there.

5. Run the program: py get_comments.py
